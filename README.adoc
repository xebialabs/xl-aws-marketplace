=== Step2: Configure a VPC and EC2 Key Pair
To run the AWS CloudFormation templates in this repository, you must set up an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC] and an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair]. If these are already created, you can go directly to the next step.

If you want to setup a fresh VPC with, click the below launch button:

=== Step 3: Configure Amazon Aurora RDS in your VPC
You must set up an https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL] database in the VPC that is accessible by XL JetPack to store its data. Furthermore, the https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora] instance must be configured with a number of databases.

There are two options to set up an Aurora database.

==== Step 3a: Existing Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL instance
If you already have an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database instance running in your VPC, click the button below to run a CloudFormation template that will provision the necessary databases in your Aurora instance.

==== Step 3b: Empty VPC
If you have an empty VPC, click the button below to run a CloudFormation template that will set up Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and provision the necessary databases.

If you've used the CloudFormation stack from step 1, use the `DataSubnetA` and `DataSubnetB` provisione

d by the template for the `DataSubnetIDs`. Also use `PrivateSubnet1A` for the `PrivateSubnetID`.

NOTE: Ensure that the subnet specified in the `PrivateSubnetID` parameter has a NAT Gateway attached and has outgoing internet access. The template will deploy a custom Lambda to the subnet which requires internet access.

An example configuration of the CloudFormation parameters looks like this:

In the last step of the CloudFormation wizard, ensure that you check both of the boxes as seen on the following image:

=== Step 4: Launch the XL JetPack stack
After you've set up an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC], an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair], and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL], you can blast off with XL JetPack.

To start XL JetPack, please click the below launch button to start the CloudFormation template that will provision the XL JetPack containers in your AWS account.

An example of the CloudFormation parameters looks like this:

In the last step of the CloudFormation wizard, ensure that you check both of the boxes as seen on the following image:
